# Newton Method

input:
x: predictors without intercept
y: response variables
beta: if not specified, 0 will be set to all coefficients
tol: the threshold to end up the function if the difference between loglike function at 2 adjacent steps below this value.
lambda_init: the initial lambda to control the number of each step and lambda will change in halving process.
decay_rate: the ratio of decayed lambda to lambda at last step in havling process.

output:
beta: a vector of coeffients

```{r}
newton_optimize = function(x, y, beta = NULL, tol = 0.001, lambda_init = 1, decay_rate = 0.5){
  
  # add the intercept
  x = cbind(rep(1, nrow(x)), x)

# Loading the data and run function

We will add the intercept in function "newton_optimize" to keep the original data.

```{r}
# read data
cancer_data = read.csv("./breast-cancer.csv")

# make the predictors, and the intercept will be added in function "newton_optimize" instead of here.
x = cancer_data %>% select(-id, -diagnosis) %>% as.matrix()

# make the response variables
y = cancer_data %>% 
  select(diagnosis) %>% 
  mutate(diagnosis = as.integer(diagnosis) - 1) %>% 
  as.matrix()


# calculate beta_hat by newton method 
beta = newton_optimize(x, y, tol = 0.01)


# check the data in glm
model = glm(y ~ x, family = "binomial")
model$coefficients
```
